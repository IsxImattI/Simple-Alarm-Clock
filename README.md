Alarm Clock Script
This Python script serves as a simple alarm clock that allows you to set an alarm for a specific time. When the time matches the set alarm time, the script will alert you by printing "ALARM!!!" to the console.

Features
Simple User Interface: The alarm time is set via a command-line prompt.
Real-Time Feedback: Continuously displays the current time and updates it every second until the alarm time is reached.
Exact Time Match: The alarm triggers exactly when the system clock matches the set time.
Requirements
To run this script, you need Python installed on your system. The script is compatible with Python 3.x and uses the following built-in libraries:

datetime: For handling time operations.
time: For creating delay to simulate real-time clock updates.
